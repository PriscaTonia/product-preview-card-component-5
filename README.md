## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow


### What I learned
I used the desktop first approach for this task. Starting with my semantic html, I designed the structure of the website, then went ahead to create Css styles for the desktop, after which I used Media queries to style the mobile views.

I practiced a litte of transition, I applied it to the button, so that it increases when it is hovered on.

### Continued development

Well, I'd love to learn more Css Styling methods, especially transitions, flex and grid.
